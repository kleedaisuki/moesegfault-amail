# First-party Login and Account clients

Read this reference only when modifying `apps/login`, `apps/account`, or an explicitly trusted replacement deployed on the paired first-party origins. External products should use OIDC instead.

## Authority boundary

Identity owns principals, identifiers, contacts, authenticators, identity sessions, grants, OAuth protocol state, and signing. Login owns registration/authentication/recovery presentation. Account owns self-service account presentation. Product services own business roles and domain data.

The repository clients are implementation examples, not a package:

- [`apps/login/src/api/client.ts`](https://github.com/kleedaisuki/moesegfault-indentity/blob/main/apps/login/src/api/client.ts) covers browser context, password/passkey ceremonies, recovery, session/authenticator/binding management, and OAuth resume.
- [`apps/account/src/api/client.ts`](https://github.com/kleedaisuki/moesegfault-indentity/blob/main/apps/account/src/api/client.ts) covers profile, avatar, contact verification, preferences, credentials, sessions, and connected applications.

Extend or refactor the relevant client instead of creating a third subtly different request wrapper.

## Browser request model

There are two cookie-bound states:

1. an anonymous browser context used to start authentication, registration, and recovery; and
2. an authenticated Identity session used by account and security operations.

The normal client lifecycle is:

1. Resolve the Identity origin from the controlled Login/Account hostname. Keep preview overrides explicit; never fall through from staging to production.
2. Fetch `GET /v1/browser-context` before an anonymous ceremony. The response establishes the browser cookie and returns a CSRF token.
3. Keep CSRF tokens in page memory. Use `credentials: include`, `cache: no-store`, and the exact media type from OpenAPI.
4. Send `x-moesegfault-csrf` and `Idempotency-Key` on mutations. Use a new key for a new logical operation; reuse the same key only when retrying that same operation after an uncertain response.
5. Treat transaction IDs, ceremony options, CSRF values, and resume URIs as short-lived server results. Do not synthesize or decode them.
6. After authentication, use the returned session-bound CSRF token. For direct Account entry, `GET /v1/me` bootstraps both account state and mutation context.
7. On `401`, transition the entire local state to anonymous and route through the paired Login origin. Do not leave stale privileged UI state visible.

Only `LOGIN_ORIGIN` may start anonymous ceremonies. Authenticated session-management commands may allow the paired Login and Account origins. Do not broaden WebAuthn RP ID or CORS to a parent domain to make a new product work; that product should be an OIDC client.

## Capability-level API map

Use OpenAPI operation IDs and schemas rather than copying endpoint details into another client.

| Capability | Typical entry | Important invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration/sign-in/recovery | Browser context, then a password operation or start/complete Passkey transaction | Start and completion are separate, expiring, idempotent operations; OAuth continuation uses only the server-provided resume URI |
| Profile and preferences | Account bootstrap, merge-patch profile/preferences | Presentation data never becomes an authentication identifier implicitly |
| Contacts | List/add/update, start verification, complete with delivered code | Adding a contact does not verify it or automatically grant login/recovery authority; use canonical `contact_id` in verification paths, normalizing legacy `identifier_id` responses at the API boundary during staggered rollout |
| Avatar | Multipart upload or delete | Keep upload on its media boundary; do not JSON/base64-wrap files |
| Credentials/recovery | Password set/delete, Passkey add/rename/revoke, recovery-code status/rotation | Preserve at least one usable authentication/recovery path; recovery codes are displayed once |
| Sessions and connected apps | List/revoke sessions or grants | Revoking a session, grant, refresh family, or current browser cookie has different scope |
| External identity bindings | List providers/bindings, start server-directed redirect, remove binding | Navigate only to the URL returned by Identity; the callback belongs to Identity |

Before adding a feature, inspect the relevant operations in [`openapi/identity.yaml`](https://github.com/kleedaisuki/moesegfault-indentity/blob/main/openapi/identity.yaml), then the domain invariants and handler tests. Do not infer a mutation body from a TypeScript view model.

For the registration/account verification sequence, its ID compatibility rule, and `Contact was not found` triage, read [contact verification](contact-verification.md).

## WebAuthn ceremonies

- Pass Identity's JSON creation/request options through the existing JSON-to-WebAuthn conversion helpers.
- Let the platform authenticator choose and return the credential. Preserve user cancellation separately from server failure.
- Send the serialized credential only to the matching completion transaction.
- Conditional mediation supplements the explicit Passkey action; it never removes the password path.
- Account-origin access does not change `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` or the expected Login origin.

## OAuth resume inside Login

When Identity sends Login an opaque authorization transaction:

1. keep it in memory and scrub it from visible/history URLs as the current router does;
2. authenticate through the normal Identity ceremony;
3. use only the response's fixed-Identity resume URI;
4. navigate the top-level browser to that URI.

The Login JavaScript must never receive or forward the authorization code itself. Identity validates and consumes the resume transaction before redirecting to the relying party's exact registered URI.
Password and Passkey completions must use the **same absolute issuer-rooted URI contract**. A root-relative `/v1/oauth/.../resume` value is not equivalent: resolving it against `login[-staging].moesegfault.dev` sends the browser to a Login page instead of the Identity Worker and leaves the transaction authenticated but unfinished. Preserve the issuer boundary when changing either ceremony or the Login navigation code; exercise the real OAuth password route in staging after deployment.

## Device authorization inside Login

The device grant is a separate first-party presentation flow, not an opaque
OAuth authorization-code resume transaction. Open `/device` with an optional
`user_code` query. Retain the code across ordinary password/Passkey sign-in, then
bootstrap session/CSRF and call `lookupDeviceAuthorization`. Compare the displayed
registered client name, code and requested scopes before sending
`decideDeviceAuthorization` with `approve` or `deny`. Both calls require the Identity
session cookie and session CSRF; neither carries an OAuth access token. They use
OAuth JSON errors and the correlation-ID response header rather than Problem
Details. These endpoints use conditional one-time state changes, not the ordinary
domain Idempotency-Key wrapper.

Opening a complete verification URL must only pre-fill the code. Never approve
from a GET, route entry, authentication completion, or background page effect.
A signed-out person returns to the pending device confirmation after sign-in,
not to the Account landing page. Show approval success as a request to return to
the initiating device, not as proof the remote application persisted its tokens.
The remote caller polls the public device grant; it never calls these cookie APIs.

## Errors and retries

- Parse RFC 9457 problem details only when the response is JSON; proxies may return HTML or an empty body.
- Branch on stable machine fields such as problem `error_code`, not localized `title` or `detail`.
- Preserve `x-moesegfault-correlation-id` on typed errors and show it in support-ready failure UI where appropriate.
- Keep user cancellation, policy rejection, invalid input, authentication failure, rate limiting, and platform failure distinguishable.
- Do not blindly retry mutations. Retry only when the operation is designed for it, using the original idempotency key and transaction context.

For opt-in failure receipts and the distinction between a generic pre-authentication rejection, OAuth continuation, and a native CLI loopback page, read [safe failure support](login-failure-support.md). Do not assume a receipt or resume fix resolved an earlier credential rejection.

## Focused verification

For a changed capability, cover the success path plus the boundary it relies on:

- correct paired origin and rejected untrusted origin;
- credentials/cookies included only where intended;
- CSRF token rotation and loss;
- duplicate mutation with the same idempotency key;
- transaction expiry or consumption;
- `401` local-state reset;
- response parsing with problem JSON and non-JSON proxy failure;
- OAuth resume as top-level navigation, not `fetch`.

Use the repository's existing Vitest suites and run only the affected workspace first. OpenAPI changes also require `npm run lint:openapi`; cross-surface contract changes require the broader repository checks documented in [`README.md`](https://github.com/kleedaisuki/moesegfault-indentity/blob/main/README.md).
